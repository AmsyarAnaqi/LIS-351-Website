        Wan Amsyar Anaqi, and I am from 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. I have been in the United States 
        for almost 2 years now. So, what am I doing here? Actually, I am a student here in the 
        <a href=https://www.wisc.edu>University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, majoring in 
        Electrical Engineering. As of now, I am in my junior year of college. One and a half year to
        go and then I'm done with my bachelor degree, how exciting! I am currently under a 
        scholarship from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petronas">PETRONAS</a>, a Malaysian
        oil and gas company. I know some people might have heard of PETRONAS before, most likely 
        those who watch Formula 1 since PETRONAS is one of the major sponsors of MERCEDES-AMG FORMULA 1
        team. I have always wanted to visit the United States since I was child. When I knew that I was 
        going here for my studies, it was like a dream came true for me.

    <h1 style="margin-top: 10%;">Hobbies</h1>
    <p style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 
    'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;"> I am a field hockey player. I have been playing hockey competitively
        since I was in high school. In fact, I also represent the Wisconsin Badgers Field Hockey Team. 
        I love playing all kind of sports especially hockey and soccer. If I'm not playing sports, 
        I would be on my laptop editing videos especially those I took from my previous trips.
        I do have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChOXWtbG7pYdISMvtZeaVKw">youtube</a> 
        channel but I haven't posted any videos for quite some time. I'm planning on releasing 2 more 
        videos by the end of this year. Fingers crossed.
